Mobile Network Performance Dashboard

This package aims to analyze urban mobile network performance using signal strength, SNR, carrier, and location data. Data engineering includes cleaning, feature transformation, and creating categorical variables like signal strength score for clearer analysis. Multiple visualizations—including heatmaps to show the spatial distribution of network strength, scatter plots to explore relationships between network metrics, and box/bar plots to compare across groups—help reveal patterns and outliers visually. A linear regression model was initially considered to quantify what factors drive download speed; however, the model showed limitations because real-world mobile network data is highly variable, includes outliers, and may not have a strong linear relationship between predictors and outcome. As a result, the linear model struggled to explain performance well and produced unreliable predictions.

To address this, K-means clustering was applied as an alternative unsupervised learning approach. Clustering groups network readings by actual similarity in behavior—allowing the dashboard to identify distinct classes of cells or zones (such as "problem areas" or "strong signal clusters") without forcing a simple linear equation. This gives a much clearer operational picture and justifies why clustering is more suitable, especially when signal and performance patterns are complex and non-linear. All these techniques are integrated into an interactive dashboard using R and Shiny, enabling users to filter, explore, and interpret network health easily, making the tool practical for network planners, engineers, and decision makers.
